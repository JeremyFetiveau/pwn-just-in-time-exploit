# Exploit for the TurboFan challenge from Google CTF 2018

`Just In Time` is a an exploitation challenge written by [Stephen 'tsuro' RÃ¶ttger](https://twitter.com/_tsuro) for [Google CTF 2018](https://github.com/google/google-ctf/tree/master/2018).

I wrote an introduction to TurboFan article on [doare-e.github.io](https://doar-e.github.io/) that explains the bug and its exploitation.

When working on v8, I use a customized engine for which I added some features. 
One of those is available [on my other repo](https://github.com/JeremyFetiveau/debugging-tools/tree/master/v8_doare-helpers).

You may also want to have a look at [a few experiments](https://github.com/JeremyFetiveau/browser-experiments).

# Overview 

For `just-in-time`, you are provided with a modified [v8](https://v8.dev/) engine.

It contains a vulnerable [TurboFan](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan) reduction (understand : optimization pass).

This reduction tries to (incorrectly) optimize duplicate additions such as `x + 1 + 2`.

This repository contains a full exploit for this bug. It also uses WebAssembly to get RWX memory.
